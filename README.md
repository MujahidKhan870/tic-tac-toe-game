Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic 2-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The game ends when a player has placed three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, or when all spaces on the board are filled, resulting in a tie.

This Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to play interactively through the console. The game continues until one player wins or all positions on the board are filled, at which point a winner (if any) is declared or a draw is announced.
